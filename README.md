# Fake News Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements a fake news prediction system using a Logistic Regression machine learning model. The system takes news articles as input and predicts whether the news is real or fake. This README file provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the project, preprocessing data, training the model, and making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Dataset

Place your training and test datasets in the `data/` directory. The CSV files should have the following structure:

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with columns like `text` (the news content) and `label` (0 for real news, 1 for fake news).
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data with a similar structure but without the `label` column.

## Making Predictions

The script `FakeNews Predictor` is used to make predictions on new data using the trained model. It reads the test data, preprocesses it, and outputs the predictions.


## Conclusion

This README file provides instructions on how to set up, train, and use a fake news prediction system based on a Logistic Regression model. Ensure your data is in the correct format and follow the steps to successfully build and deploy the model.

For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
